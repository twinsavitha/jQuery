directives
directive definition object
link function
controller function

--
directives are basically custom html tags or elements that allow u to perform custom functionality. 

----

directives definition object
a directives has three things
link
controller
DDO - directive definition object : tells the compiler how a directive is supposed to be assembeled. 
 common properties are the link function, controller function, restrict, replace, template and templateUrl

replace: tells angular to replace the DOM element that the directive is defined upon. for eg.. if we hav the directive on a div and we want to replace it with an input tag.. 

Restrict:
restricts the definition of the directive (default is attribute) (ECMA for ECMA script)
E - Element
C - Class
M - Comment
A - Attribute

*****IMPORTANT****
when making ur own directives... in the js file use camel casing.. but in tht html code.. use snake casing..

.directive('myRectangle',function() {
	return { 
		templateURL : ,
		restrict: 'E',
		replace: true
		};
});

<my-rectangle>M/my-rectangle>
*************************

Template URL
Replace the current contents of the DOM element with the content of the templated loaded from teh templateUrl. 
-------

The link function

In angularJS it is frowned upon if ur controller directly changes the DOM. 

The link function is where the DOM manupulation happens.
The link function comes with scope, element and attrs. attrs are the params set into the link function. 

scope is same as $scope in the controller function.

element is a jQuery instance of the DOM element the direcive is declared on. Angular is shipped witha jQuery version called JQlite.. simplified version used for DOM clearing. 

attrs is a list of attributes declared on the element. 

----

controller functions. 
the controller constructed during the pre-linking phase recieves the $scope which is the current scope for the element.
