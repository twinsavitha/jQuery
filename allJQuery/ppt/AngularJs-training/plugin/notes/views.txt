we have build the chasis of the car.. now time to add some paneling paint and come effects.. 

Views with a template.
angular directives tour (come with angular),
layout directives - control layout of the page
event directives/interactive directives handle interaction from user and pass it to the controller
styling directives actually does not affect the layout but its styling through dynamic css.

-------

the view is AngularJS compiled DOM.
The view is a product of $compile merging the HTML template with $scope. 
DOM is no longer the single source of truth. the state is pulled into the controller and controlled by scope. 


<image>

template > compiiled > angularjs view.

between the view and model we have a digest cycle that something happens eg an event ng-click.
or something happend to the model, eg we get data from the server.. the model forms the view.

-----
we add module name
we add controller
we define the param on scope
it evaluates to something.

Layout Directives
directives that control teh layout of the page
ngif
ngShow/ngHide
ngRepeat
ngSwitch
ngInclude

based on the value of the expression that u bind it to 
ngif = true/false it will add or remove that element from the DOM. 
ngShow/ngHide is cousin.. dosent remove.. but make the display = none. its still in the DOM tree.

ngRepeat it takes a collection on scope and for every element defined upon eg div in that collection.. it will create a copy of that element(div) and create a child scope that u can bind to and display. eg an array of user object.. <div ng-repeat " user in users">
 it will create a div for evey user in that array then us can bind to individual obj.
{{user.name}}

handy way to do a layout when u just have the collection and u define the template and attach to ng repeat.
also has a $index which store the count.

$switch where it will attach fragments of html.. based on value of expression..  

nginclude : actually ref to a different template file and asynchronously load and display. similar to ngview but that changes on route change.
It injects the new template in the element and adds the scope to it. when the template changes.. it duplicates itself (the element) and deletes the older one. 

** anything with an ng- for an attribute dosent need to have expressions becoz the string itself is the expression so we dont need the curly braces.

** ng-include and ng-repeat automatically update the data chain.. so if a value of the element changes . the ng-repeat will also update it automatically.
similarly if in ng-include the expression changes it will update and download the new template


ng-options 
age for age in generateAges()

Interaction directives

used in view to issue commands and provide value to the controller. 

ngModel - set a value on a form. eg text input used to represent the first name .. ng-model = firstname. thus scope.firstname..

ngBlur/ngFocus - fired when u control focus or blow out. ngblur is used to edit and plce. so if someone edits a form element we can issue a command to the controller to update that value on the server. 

ngClick - button click 

ngSubmit - to submit form to submit by pressing 
enter.
